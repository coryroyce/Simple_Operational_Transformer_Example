# Simple_Operational_Transformer_Example

Simple Operational Transformer Example takes in an old string and a new string (used in version control) along with a simple set of operations to verify if the changes match.
This simple coding exercise was inspired by a coding question from [Repl.it](https://otcatchup.util.repl.co/)

The isMatch function was created just from a few example before and after strings and returs True if the oprations tranform the string correctly and false otherwise.
